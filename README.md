# The `rizqy.me` Source Code

I always wanted to design and build my own personal sites in long time, exploring tools and generators; but at the end I never realize it. Previously I built my site with WordPress, with full comfort drag-n-drop magic experience. I never really touch its codes or try to build my own personal theme. Then I stopped writing, though I still wrote occasionally on Medium.

This year, I'd like to revisit my writing habit. May this new site brings new hope and help me write actively.
